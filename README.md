Kanjimate
Animations of kanji with the correct stroke order!

This project was inspired by Jisho.org with their kanji stroke order and gifs of drawing kanji. 
Similar to Jisho.org, this project uses KanjiVG's repository of kanji SVGs that includes 
correct stroke order plus other useful information. KanjiVG can be found at https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/. 

In order to learn web development, my aim was to build this website with as close to vanilla JavaScript as possible 
such that it would not have dependencies and to build a strong foundation for the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
